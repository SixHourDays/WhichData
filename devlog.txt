bugs:

done:
listen for undock/redock/sep/shear/die, containers, experi, labs and antenna joining or leaving the ship need accounted for
review is all aboard
create list of all experiments reviewed
add move button
provide 'keep' button function in a close button
listen for hide ui
< 0.1 sci transmit = 0% on button
title and box restored
lab & trans btn #'s restored
dont render in 0 scidata case (GUIView)
remember that AUTO properties give a free private backing store, NORMAL properties I have to provide it!!

doing:
why does the lab value not work like it used to?
control is update, internal collection pump, update
view is a HACK mess to get a single select going
final split class reorganize of the two info panes
put some of the select code back in GUIView

part gain / loss updates to data - shitty full rebuild in control, shitty full copy to view
temporarily running single only to finish links across objects
control & view datas parred down, view nest constructs off control, handy properties to hide members
dialog visually matches: so trans + next trans is 1px off.....

todo:
list selection to view info pane (passback,passfwd)
alt-click group selection in list
make original buttons work on selected (passback x2)
partial button operation: x of n selected can be labbed, etc
create sort toggles on list entries
sort list with ranked toggling
review data spawns my dialog instead
reviewed / new data highlights
move btn gains 2nd step: UI hide + destination mouse pick
listen for crew board/eva do alter the scientist clean right click menu
listen for deployed/reviewdata to catch more science inserting to the dialog
more sorts: lab copy, container, 
failsafes: moves of dupes to pods and lab copies already done should STAY
gather right-click for pod, when any exp has data in it
clean right-click for pod, when any exp is spent & scientist is aboard
eva get/StoreData trigger dialog
save selected state & position to ship file
