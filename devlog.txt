bugs:

done:
listen for undock/redock/sep/shear/die, containers, experi, labs and antenna joining or leaving the ship need accounted for
review is all aboard
create list of all experiments reviewed
add move button
provide 'keep' button function in a close button
listen for hide ui
< 0.1 sci transmit = 0% on button
title and box restored
lab & trans btn #'s restored
dont render in 0 scidata case (GUIView)
remember that AUTO properties give a free private backing store, NORMAL properties I have to provide it!!
explicitly wrote the experi->research pts conversion (thanks xEvilReeperx), to fix lab pts
GUIView registers single/group selections
BaseInfoPane can now sum & display a group of ViewPages
control, not GUIView, now determines proper action button locking based on selection & model state
GUIView self-switches between BaseInfoPane and ViewPageInfoPane depending on selection
list selection to view info pane (passback,passfwd)
alt-click group selection in list
control tracks selectees
make original buttons work on selected (passback x2)
partial button operation: x of n selected can be labbed, etc
GUI makes buttons act as 'up' when not displaying (no more holdover pushes)
closing pick mode is now click away / not container, instead of Esc.
move btn gains 2nd step: UI hide + destination mouse pick
DataPage now implements IEquatable, so it will do value comparisons, which will catch identical scidata in different parts, etc
Model now posses DataPages; maintains coherency in scans, eliminates the m_sciDataParts dictionary
abstracted the work, wait on ksp, work loop into DataProcessors for each action (including all removedatas)
integrated Compare<T> into SortField as a factory.  Takes a field accessor dlgt, builds the needed comparer dlgt, and news the SortField
SortField gained a 3rd state for descending sorts.
create sort toggles on list entries
sort list with ranked toggling
Added lab copy sort field.

bugs:
spamming action buttons during queued work
doing move has highlighted that flat sci list isnt enough:
- you can move it, get same flat order, but be in whole diff parts, no update push to sel, etc
- similarly its possible to have to identical subjectIDs in the m_sciDataParts dictionary :-( (equals or what?)
control w no control!  hah

doing:
decided next greatest threat is EVA mode, jumping to that
deal with the shutdown mid-copy thing
check/solve the multiple copies in lab scenario
sciences going to R&D should also retrigger the dialogs...bar values will change
evolving sequence is: model->control->view, view input->control, control->model & view
part gain / loss updates to data - shitty full rebuild in control, shitty full copy to view
dialog visually matches: so trans + next trans is 1px off.....

todo:
update group text for when move / lab / radio is disabled
preservation of selectees across model changes.
listen for deployed to catch more science inserting to the dialog
listen for reset to clear a data
review data spawns my dialog instead
reviewed / new data highlights
listen for crew board/eva do alter the scientist clean right click menu
more sorts: container
gather right-click for pod, when any exp has data in it
clean right-click for pod, when any exp is spent & scientist is aboard
eva get/StoreData trigger dialog
save selected state & position to ship file
