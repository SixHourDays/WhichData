done:
listen for undock/redock/sep/shear/die, containers, experi, labs and antenna joining or leaving the ship need accounted for
review is all aboard
create list of all experiments reviewed
add move button
provide 'keep' button function in a close button
listen for hide ui
< 0.1 sci transmit = 0% on button
title and box restored
lab & trans btn #'s restored
dont render in 0 scidata case (GUIView)
remember that AUTO properties give a free private backing store, NORMAL properties I have to provide it!!
explicitly wrote the experi->research pts conversion (thanks xEvilReeperx), to fix lab pts
GUIView registers single/group selections
BaseInfoPane can now sum & display a group of ViewPages
control, not GUIView, now determines proper action button locking based on selection & model state
GUIView self-switches between BaseInfoPane and ViewPageInfoPane depending on selection
list selection to view info pane (passback,passfwd)
alt-click group selection in list
control tracks selectees
make original buttons work on selected (passback x2)
partial button operation: x of n selected can be labbed, etc
GUI makes buttons act as 'up' when not displaying (no more holdover pushes)
closing pick mode is now click away / not container, instead of Esc.
move btn gains 2nd step: UI hide + destination mouse pick
DataPage now implements IEquatable, so it will do value comparisons, which will catch identical scidata in different parts, etc
Model now posses DataPages; maintains coherency in scans, eliminates the m_sciDataParts dictionary
abstracted the work, wait on ksp, work loop into DataProcessors for each action (including all removedatas)
integrated Compare<T> into SortField as a factory.  Takes a field accessor dlgt, builds the needed comparer dlgt, and news the SortField
SortField gained a 3rd state for descending sorts.
create sort toggles on list entries
sort list with ranked toggling
Added lab copy sort field.
listen for deployed to catch more science inserting to the dialog
module manager patch created, part module created, it ghosts the stock containers and replaces their events.
our Take Data x, Store Data x replacement events notify our model, and call stock versions
part gain / loss updates to data - loss and gain deltas pushed to control and view
preservation of selectees across model changes.
always-on-if-science-aboard turned off
close button works again
reviewed / new data spawns & highlights
vessel switch working
review experi highlights & spawns
module manager dependency removed, dynamically lazy load helpers
kerb helpers working (helpers pair up w experis by index in search order of ship, fixing multi-experi parts like eva kerbals)
Helpers deal with eva-only peculiarities: suppress experi events for extern-extern deploys & data takes (match pod behavior)
view can disable discard button
twin-model overhaul
mode swaps now generally safer - bailing out of picker,collect is handled right
eva "Take/Store Which Data..." triggers dialog, and works! huzzah - the original goal!
experiments now properly reset on discard (instead of actual discard, disabling goos and matlabs)
eva Kerbal locks out review data move, so soil & eva report aren't moveable to themselves
externReview/collect/store cancels on eva distance
dialog status header, shows state, ship name, labbing / transmitting
takeAll/storeAll during collect/store works for experi (monitors module to complete then notify)
listen for reset to clear a data
listen for crew board/eva do alter the scientist clean right click menu
decided scientists alone can discard while take/store, and take while keeping/discarding result.
synced active and extern views in window space
gather right-click for pod, when any exp has data in it
clean right-click for pod, when any exp is spent & scientist is aboard
prompts for partial selections and why they happen
view snaps scroll to best fit of hard selections

doing:
deal with the shutdown mid-copy thing
check/solve the multiple copies in lab scenario
sciences going to R&D should also retrigger the dialogs...bar values will change
dialog visually matches: so trans + next trans is 1px off.....

bugs:
take which then take all doesnt close, but leaves one hanging non-existant entry
equals finds dupes of something in cont and experi it came from...host is relevant, as is host index
take data reacts like science deploy...overzealous event handler in model
spamming action buttons during queued work
doing move has highlighted that flat sci list isnt enough:
- you can move it, get same flat order, but be in whole diff parts, no update push to sel, etc
- similarly its possible to have to identical subjectIDs in the m_sciDataParts dictionary :-( (equals or what?)
control w no control!  hah

todo:

update group text for when move / lab / radio is disabled
more sorts: container
save selected state & position to ship file

Why the ExperimentResultDialog isn't good enough:
Only represents just-deployed or reviewed science, not whole onboard science payload
No coherency - pages are spawned and forgotten, not logically attached to a part & data
Gives you no knowledge of the *other* ship in an eva get/store
