review data spawns my dialog instead
dialog visually matches
create list of all experiments reviewed
create sort toggles on list entries
sort list with ranked toggling
list selection to view info pane
alt-click group selection in list
make original buttons work on selected
provide 'keep' button function in a close button
partial button operation: x of n selected can be labbed, etc
add move button
move btn gains 2nd step: UI hide + destination mouse pick


fixed dupe copy doubling...but no note of skip
i think missing Ships/VAB/SPH dirs were screwing up VAB buttons
find all IScienceDataContainers as PartModules and listing science works nicely
experi deploy, crew board/eva, part die, stage activate/sep, redock, transfer
test remainig ( undock)

note antenna/lab destroy, not just container destroy, effects the dialog :-)
more sorts: lab copy, container, 
failsafes: moves of dupes to pods and lab copies already done should STAY
review is all aboard, selects reviewed
new data highlights
part gain / loss updates to data
gather right-click for pod, when any exp has data in it
clean right-click for pod, when any exp is spent & scientist is aboard
eva get/StoreData trigger dialog
