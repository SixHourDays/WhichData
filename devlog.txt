review data spawns my dialog instead
dialog visually matches
create list of all experiments reviewed
create sort toggles on list entries
sort list with ranked toggling
list selection to view info pane
alt-click group selection in list
make original buttons work on selected
provide 'keep' button function in a close button
partial button operation: x of n selected can be labbed, etc
add move button
move btn gains 2nd step: UI hide + destination mouse pick


fixed dupe copy doubling...but no note of skip
find all IScienceDataContainers as PartModules and listing science works nicely
experi deploy, crew board/eva/transfer, part die, stage activate/sep, dock/undock, partjoint break

PARADIGM SHIFT
ok.  up till now we're based around the ExperiResultDW and its horribleness.  This was due to needing its callbacks to perform KSP functions.
But...you think you've found all the callback calls.
	keep, as we have know from the begnning...does jack shit.
	ModuleScienceContainer::DumpData(ScienceData data);									//discard
	ModuleScienceExperiment::ResetExperiment();											//reset
	ModuleScienceLab::ProcessData(ScienceData item, Callback<ScienceData> onComplete);	//lab clone
	ModuleDataTransmitter::TransmitData(List<ScienceData> dataQueue, Callback callback)	//transmit
So.  Can we actually skip the ExperiResultDW altogether?


in pursuit of presenting an 'all data onboard' view of the dialog
load will do full ship scan, track experi, containers, and all onboard data, as well as antenna and lab presence
then we listen..
listen for undock/redock/sep/shear/die, containers, experi, labs and antenna joining or leaving the ship need accounted for
listen for crew board/eva do alter the scientist clean right click menu
listen for deployed/reviewdata to catch more science inserting to the dialog
how to listen for take data on eva?

more sorts: lab copy, container, 
failsafes: moves of dupes to pods and lab copies already done should STAY
review is all aboard, selects reviewed
new data highlights
part gain / loss updates to data
gather right-click for pod, when any exp has data in it
clean right-click for pod, when any exp is spent & scientist is aboard
eva get/StoreData trigger dialog
listen for active vessel switch
listen for hide ui
save selected state & position to ship file
